# MCR family porting plan (Tang Console 60K)

Rewritten 2026-07 after vendoring the five MiSTer MCR cores into `refs/`
(local reference checkouts, gitignored — nested git repos). This replaces
the earlier speculative roadmap: everything below is verified against the
actual sources.

## What the survey established

All five cores are the same dar/sorgelig lineage as our `mcr2.vhd` — one
core `.vhd` each, identical support files (T80, Z80CTC, `dpram`,
`gen_ram`, `cmos_ram`, `spinner.sv`), the **same `clock_40` input, the
same external CPU/sound ROM ports, and the same `dl_` download bus** our
SD loader already drives. The 60K platform (framebuffer/HDMI, analog
video, OSD, SD loader+prefs, USB, beacon, shield header) carries over
unchanged for every family.

| refs/ core | Games (from the MRAs) | Sound | ROM home on MiSTer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arcade-MCR1 | Kick, Solar Fox | SSIO (same `mcr_sound_board.vhd` we ship) | **all BRAM** — no sdram.sv in the repo |
| Arcade-MCR3 | Tapper, Timber, Journey, Discs of Tron | SSIO + `wave_sound.sv` sample player (Journey tape music; **DoT speech absent upstream** — Squawk & Talk was never implemented) | CPU+sound+sprites in SDRAM, bg (32 KB) via `dl_` into BRAM |
| Arcade-MCR3Scroll | Spy Hunter, Crater Raider, Turbo Tag | SSIO + Cheap Squeak Deluxe (`cheap_squeak_deluxe.vhd`, FX68K) | SDRAM |
| Arcade-MCR3Mono | Rampage, Sarge, Max RPM, Power Drive, Star Guards, Demolition Derby (mono) | Turbo Cheap Squeak (`cpu09l` 6809) / Sounds Good (FX68K) — no SSIO | SDRAM |

Memory reality on the 60K (118 BSRAM blocks, ~78 free ≈ 156 KB for game
ROM after platform + core RAM):

- **MCR-1 fits BRAM trivially** (Kick ≈ 50 KB, Solar Fox ≈ 80 KB;
  `cpu_rom_addr` is only 15 bits). No new memory hardware.
- **Every MCR-3 family needs the SDRAM module** — sprite ROM alone is
  128 KB (Tapper) to 256 KB (Rampage); MiSTer's own `sdram.sv` multi-port
  arcade controller is in each refs/ repo, purpose-built for these cores.

## Phase A — MCR-1 core: Kick, Kickman, Solar Fox   [IN PROGRESS]

**Status 2026-07: the core builds.** `src/rtl/mcr1.vhd` vendored + patched
(hcnt_out/vcnt_out exposed; three gfx dprams given INIT_FILE and explicit
we_a/we_b tie-offs, since our SV dpram has no VHDL port defaults). New
`mcr1_console60k/` board project (MCR-2 top with the core swapped: 15-bit
CPU ROM + MCR-1 download map, 4-bit RGB truncated to the shared 3:3:3
pipeline, per-game input mux). merge_roms grew `family`-aware output and
kick/kickman/solarfox specs; osd.sv parameterized for the 2-game roster.
Kick: BSRAM 77/118, setup +0.585 ns. Bitstreams in `bitstreams/`
(console60k_mcr1_kick.fs, console60k_mcr1_solarfox.fs). **Not yet flashed
/ hardware-verified**; SD pack switching waits on pack-v2 (below), so for
now each MCR-1 game is a baked bitstream.

Remaining before Phase A is closed:
- Flash + verify Kick and Solar Fox on hardware (video, sound, controls).
  Kick's spinner sensitivity and both games' DIP default (input_3 = 0xFF
  placeholder) will likely need tuning; OSD text rotation direction on the
  rotated MCR-1 monitors is a guess.
- Pack format v2 so MCR-1 games load from SD like MCR-2 (see below).

Original work items (mostly done):

1. **Diff the shared support files first** (`refs/Arcade-MCR1_MiSTer/rtl/`
   vs our `src/rtl/`): ours carry local fixes (dpram INIT_FILE ROM mode,
   mcr2 bg download decode). Take `mcr1.vhd`; keep ours for everything
   shared.
2. Vendor `mcr1.vhd` → `src/rtl/`. Its download map differs from MCR-2
   (verified): sprites `0x10000-0x17FFF`, bg1 `0x18000-0x18FFF`, bg2
   `0x19000-0x19FFF`; CPU ROM is 32 KB max, sound 16 KB.
3. `merge_roms.py`: add `kick`, `kickman`, `solarfox` specs (zips already
   in `roms/`), writing the MCR-1 layout; `make_rompack.py` gains a
   **pack format v2**: per-slot family byte + name, so one card serves
   every family bitstream and the loader refuses cross-family slots.
4. New `mcr1_console60k/` project = copy of the 60K project with the core
   swapped and a 2-game input mux (Kick: spinner on IP1 via `spinner.sv`,
   1 button; Solar Fox: stick + 2 buttons — bit maps from MAME mcr.cpp,
   recorded in `mcr_game_input_matrix.md` as we did for MCR-2).
5. OSD: game names come from the pack header (already written there by
   `make_rompack.py`) instead of hardcoded strings — after that, no
   family ever touches menu RTL again. Prefs record gains the family
   byte (sector format has room).

Deliverable: `bitstreams/console60k_mcr1.fs` — boots Kick, OSD switches
between the three, prefs persist. **This phase is deliberately first: it
forces all the multi-family packaging decisions while the RTL risk is
near zero.**

## Phase B — SDRAM module bring-up (the gate for all MCR-3)   [STARTED]

**Standalone memtest built (2026-07), not yet hardware-run.** The exact
controller MCR-3 will use is vendored and Gowin-adapted:
`src/rtl/sdram_gw.sv` = MiSTer MCR-3 `sdram.sv` with the Altera altddio_out
SDRAM_CLK forwarder replaced by a Gowin ODDR and the `inout reg SDRAM_DQ`
rewritten as an explicit tristate (Gowin rejects procedural drives of an
inout). A 100 MHz PLL (`gowin_pll_sdram.v`) feeds it (refresh timing sized
for ~100 MHz). `src/rtl/sdram_memtest.sv` sweeps 1M words (write pattern ->
read back -> compare) on port1; the diag top
`mcr2_console60k/diag/sdram_memtest_top.sv` reports on the four J10 LEDs
(PASS/DONE/FAIL/heartbeat) and the UART beacon. SDRAM pins from
`docs/pinrefs/snestang_console.cst` (verified nand2mario mapping, CS=F21).
Bitstream: `bitstreams/console60k_sdram_memtest.fs` (builds clean, timing
met at 100 MHz). FSM logic is Verilator-validated (`make -C sim memtest`:
clean memory PASSes, an injected bad word is caught at the right address).

**On hardware:** plug the Tang SDRAM module into J9, flash the memtest,
watch the LEDs. DONE+PASS = the module, pins and clock phase are good. If
reads fail (DONE+FAIL), the likely culprit is the SDRAM_CLK phase - swap
D0/D1 on the ODDR in `sdram_gw.sv` (the one documented phase knob) and
rebuild.

Remaining Phase B:
1. Run the memtest on real hardware; tune the clock phase if needed.
2. Retire the F19/F20 PMOD buttons (they overlap nothing here, but will
   when the module is wired into a real board build).
3. `rom_loader` v3: stream slots >128 KB through the `dl_` path into SDRAM
   (MiSTer's `rom_download` wiring in `Arcade-MCR3.sv` is the template).
   Pack v2 carries per-slot sizes.

## Phase C — MCR-3 core: Tapper, Timber, Journey, Discs of Tron   [CORE READY]

**The core is vendored and platform-adapted (2026-07):** `src/rtl/mcr3.vhd`
patched exactly like mcr1/mcr2 (bg dprams get INIT_FILE + explicit
we_a/we_b/d/q tie-offs; palette we_b/d_b; `hcntout` already exposed
upstream). It uses only our shared entities (dpram/gen_ram/mcr_sound_board/
T80s/z80ctc) and has no Altera constructs, so it will build once wired into
a board. The remaining work is board integration, which is **SDRAM-gated**
- do it after the Phase B memtest passes on hardware. The design below is
settled so that integration is mechanical, not exploratory.

### Memory split (verified against Arcade-MCR3.sv + the core's ports)

| ROM | Size | Home | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU program | ~56-64 KB | **BRAM** (baked, INIT_FILE) | like mcr1/2; `cpu_rom_addr`[15:0] |
| Sound (SSIO) | 16 KB | **BRAM** (baked) | `snd_rom_addr`[13:0] |
| Background | 32 KB (2x16 KB) | **BRAM** (baked, INIT_FILE done) | `dl_`/INIT_FILE, dl[15:14]=00/01 |
| **Sprites** | **128 KB** | **SDRAM** (loaded from SD at boot) | `sp_addr`[14:0] -> `sp_q`[31:0], 32-bit |
| **Journey tape samples** | ~MBs | **DDR3** (the framebuffer's) | `wave_sound.sv` + a DDR3 read port |

Only sprites (+ Journey's tape) need external memory; everything else bakes
into BRAM, so no-SD-card boots the game logic + background (sprites blank
until loaded). Budget ~ Tron's 94/118 + the sprite path.

### Sprite SDRAM layout (copy MiSTer's interleave EXACTLY)

The 4 sprite planes are merged into 32-bit words so one `sp_addr` read
returns all four. When loading the 128 KB sprite region (byte offset
`o` = 0..0x1FFFF within the region) into SDRAM via a write port, use
MiSTer's remap verbatim (`Arcade-MCR3.sv`):
- word address = `{o[18:17], o[14:0], o[16]}`
- byte select   = `{o[15], ~o[15]}`  (which half of the 16-bit word)
- write data    = `{byte, byte}`
Reads: `sp_addr` -> `sp_q[31:0]`; the core's `sp_mux_roms`/`sp_hflip`
logic already picks the right plane byte.

### Clocking / CDC (the one real design choice)

Core runs at 40 MHz (`clock_40`); the SDRAM controller (`sdram_gw`) is
proven at 100 MHz (Phase B memtest). `sp_addr` (40 MHz) -> `sp_q`
(100 MHz) crosses domains. Two options:
1. **Match MiSTer**: SDRAM at 100 MHz, register `sp_addr` into the SDRAM
   clock; the core holds `sp_addr` stable across several 40 MHz cycles so
   the 100 MHz controller samples it cleanly (this is what MiSTer relies
   on). Preferred - reuses the exact memtest clock.
2. SDRAM at 80 MHz = 2x40 from one PLL (synchronous 1:2, no metastability),
   but re-size `RFRSH_CYCLES` for 80 MHz and re-verify sprite-fetch
   bandwidth. Fallback if option 1's CDC misbehaves.

### Boot sprite loader (SD -> SDRAM)

New `sprite_loader`: read the sprite region from the SD pack, apply the
remap above, write `sdram_gw` port1 (toggle handshake, ~128 KB ~= a few
ms). Runs before the core leaves reset. **No baked fallback** - SDRAM is
volatile, so MCR-3 needs the SD card for sprites (CPU/bg still baked, so
the game boots and shows background even cardless). This is "pack v2"
territory: the pack carries a per-slot sprite region + family tag.

### Games, in order

1. **Tapper, Timber** first - plain SSIO sound, sprites-in-SDRAM only, no
   wave/speech. The clean first targets.
2. **Journey** - needs the DDR3 wave-sample port (`wave_sound.sv`; tape
   music lives in DDRAM per the MiSTer top). Set `mcr2p5=1` (Journey is
   MCR-2.5 hardware).
3. **Discs of Tron** - ships without speech initially (Squawk & Talk =
   6809 + TMS5200 was never implemented upstream); `video_hflip=1`.

Core I/O to drive: `video_hflip`/`video_vflip` = 0 upright (DoT hflip=1),
`output_4` open, `mcr2p5` = 1 only for Journey. Input maps per game from
mcr.cpp (Tapper 2x2-way sticks + pour/serve; Timber 2 sticks + chop;
Journey stick + button; DoT stick + aim spinner on the Opt X bus).

Deliverable: `console60k_mcr3.fs`, Tapper + Timber first; the marquee
titles.

## Phase D — MCR3Scroll: Spy Hunter, Crater Raider, Turbo Tag   [CORE READY]

**Core vendored + adapted (2026-07):** `src/rtl/mcr3scroll.vhd` patched
like the others — the three gfx dprams (char + 2 bg) get INIT_FILE +
we_a/we_b/d/q tie-offs, palette gets we_b/d_b, and `hcnt_out` is added
(this core didn't expose the raster counter; its scanner is the same
633-wrap as the rest). Board integration is **SDRAM-gated** (same 128 KB
sprite port as MCR-3) — build after the Phase B memtest passes.

### Sound stack (all verified Gowin-clean, vendor at board-build time)

Spy Hunter and Turbo Tag add the **Cheap Squeak Deluxe** board, a 68000 +
DAC music board instantiated *inside* `mcr3scroll.vhd` as
`cheap_squeak_deluxe.vhd`. Its dependencies, all confirmed portable (no
Altera primitives):
- `refs/Arcade-MCR3Scroll_MiSTer/rtl/cheap_squeak_deluxe.vhd` (gen_ram +
  a 6821 PIA),
- `pia6821.vhd`,
- **FX68K** (`FX68K/fx68k.sv`, `fx68kAlu.sv`, `uaddrPla.sv` + the
  `microrom.mem`/`nanorom.mem` microcode) — generic SystemVerilog, reads
  its microcode via `$readmemb` (the only "altera" strings in it are
  `// altera message_off` comment pragmas). This is the first FX68K on the
  platform; MCR3Mono reuses it (Sounds Good), so proving it here is a
  one-time cost.
- `steering_control.vhd` for Spy Hunter's wheel/pedals.

### Memory split

Same as MCR-3 (CPU/sound/bg baked BRAM; sprites -> SDRAM) plus:
- **char/alpha graphics** (Spy Hunter status line): baked BRAM,
  `rom_gfx_ch.hex`, dl 0x8000.
- **CSD 68000 ROM** (`csd_rom_addr`[14:1] -> `csd_rom_do`[15:0], 16-bit):
  baked BRAM (Spy Hunter/Turbo only).
- `csd_audio_out`[9:0] mixes into the main audio for those games.

### Games, in order

1. **Crater Raider** first — SSIO-only (`mod_crater=1`), CSD unused (tie
   `csd_rom_do` off, ignore `csd_audio_out`). The clean first target, no
   FX68K risk.
2. **Spy Hunter** — CSD sound (FX68K) + `steering_control` (wheel/gas on
   the Opt X bus) + the **lamp panel** (`show_lamps` -> the shield's
   74HC595 chain; add a second '595, zero header pins).
3. **Turbo Tag** (`mod_turbo=1`) — prototype; CSD sound.

Extra core I/O: `mod_crater`/`mod_turbo` (game select), `show_lamps`
(Spy Hunter lamps), `output_4` (SSIO out, drives the input mux + lamps).

## Phase E — MCR3Mono: Rampage, Sarge, Max RPM, Power Drive, Star Guards   [CORE READY]

**Core vendored + adapted (2026-07):** `src/rtl/mcr3mono.vhd` patched like
the others (two bg dprams get INIT_FILE + we_a/we_b/d/q tie-offs, palette
gets we_b/d_b, `hcnt_out` added). Uses only vendorable entities. Board
integration is **SDRAM-gated**, and this is the heaviest MCR title set.

### Sound stack (both boards compiled in, selected by `soundsgood`)

The mono board carries no SSIO sound Z80; instead the core instantiates
BOTH sound boards and the `soundsgood` input picks one:
- **Turbo Cheap Squeak** (`turbo_cheap_squeak.vhd`) = a 6809
  (`cpu09l_128a.vhd`, the new CPU here) + `pia6821.vhd` + gen_ram. Used by
  Sarge, Max RPM, Power Drive.
- **Sounds Good** (`sounds_good.vhd`) = FX68K (already proven portable in
  Phase D) + pia6821. Used by Rampage, Star Guards.
All confirmed Gowin-clean (no Altera primitives; cpu09 reads no vendor
macros). Vendor list at board-build: `cpu09l_128a.vhd`,
`turbo_cheap_squeak.vhd`, `sounds_good.vhd`, `pia6821.vhd`, FX68K.

### Memory split (the heaviest of the family)

| ROM | Size | Home |
|---|---|---|
| CPU program | 64 KB | BRAM (baked) |
| Background | **64 KB** (2x32 KB) | BRAM (baked) - large; watch the block budget |
| **Sprites** | **256 KB** (16-bit `sp_addr`) | **SDRAM** - biggest sprite load of any MCR game |
| **Sounds Good ROM** | **256 KB** (18-bit addr, 16-bit) | **SDRAM** (Rampage/Star Guards); MiSTer's `snd` port remap |
| Turbo Cheap Squeak ROM | ~48 KB (8-bit) | BRAM (baked) - small |

The 64 KB bg + 64 KB CPU baked in BRAM is tight alongside the framebuffer;
if it doesn't fit, move a bg plane to SDRAM (a second read port) or start
with a smaller-bg game. **Sarge (TCS) is the clean first target**: only
sprites need SDRAM (TCS sound ROM is small enough to bake), so it's the
mono analog of "Crater first" / "Tapper first."

### Games, in order

1. **Sarge** - TCS sound (6809, baked ROM), sprites in SDRAM only.
2. **Rampage** - Sounds Good (FX68K) with its 256 KB ROM in SDRAM too;
   the full heavy path.
3. Max RPM, Power Drive (TCS), Star Guards (Sounds Good).

### Bonus unlocked here

Once Turbo Cheap Squeak is vendored, **Demolition Derby's 4-player version
(`demoderb`) is MCR-2 hardware + TCS** - it slots straight into the
existing `mcr2.vhd` core (add the TCS instance + its input map), no mono
board needed. A free extra game on the already-shipping MCR-2 build.

## Cross-cutting decisions (do once, in Phase A)

- **Pack format v2**: version byte, per-slot {family, sector count,
  name}; loader rejects slots whose family byte doesn't match the
  running bitstream; OSD renders names from the header. Bigger slots
  (MCR-3: 512 KB; sample regions: MBs) are just sector counts.
- **Prefs v2**: add the family byte so the future multiboot selector
  (spec §7d) can pick the right *bitstream*, not just the right slot.
  Until multiboot exists, switching families = reflash (openFPGALoader
  one-liner, documented in README).
- **One board project per family** (`mcr1_console60k/` …): same top
  structure, different core + input mux. Shared fixes keep living in
  `src/`.
- **refs/ hygiene**: `refs/` is gitignored reference material (nested
  git checkouts). We copy files out deliberately, with a dated comment,
  as with every previous vendor (usb_hid_host, ddr3fb).

## Sequencing rationale

A before B because packaging decisions are cheaper to iterate on a
2-game BRAM core than on an SDRAM bring-up; B gates C/D/E; C first among
the MCR-3s because Tapper/DoT are the marquee titles and it needs no new
CPU cores (SSIO only); D before E so FX68K clocking is proven on one
board (CSD) before it appears twice more (Sounds Good).
