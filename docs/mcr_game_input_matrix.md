# MCR Game Input Matrix (machine-readable)

Transcribed from `docs/MCR_Master_Pinouts.pdf` ("Ultimate MCR Master Pinout
Matrix"). This is the source of truth for what each cabinet connector pin
does per game. The physical wiring is identical across MCR-1/2/3 — only the
in-game meaning changes, so all game-specific mapping is done in the FPGA
top-level, never on the shield PCB.

Legend: `-` = N/C for that game. "No J5" (MCR-1 and most MCR-2 cabinets have
no J5 harness) is also shown as `-`.

Games: SF=Solar Fox (MCR-1), KK=Kick/Kickman (MCR-1), TR=Tron (MCR-2),
SH=Satan's Hollow (MCR-2), KZ=Kozmik Krooz'r (MCR-2), WA=Wacko (MCR-2),
DM=Domino Man (MCR-2), TA=Tapper (MCR-3), JO=Journey (MCR-3), TI=Timber
(MCR-3), DT=Discs of Tron (MCR-3), SY=Spy Hunter (MCR-3), CR=Crater Raider
(MCR-3).

## J3 — System & coins (identical across all games)

|---|---|---|
| J3-1 | Coin 1 | all games |

| J3-5 | Tilt | all games |

## J4 — Opt X / 8-bit parallel dial data

Wiring is identical for every game: J4-1..J4-7 = data bits 0–6, J4-8 = key,
J4-9 = data bit 7, J4-10 = ground. Per-game meaning of the 8-bit bus:

| Game | J4 bus meaning |
|---|---|
| Solar Fox, Satan's Hollow, Domino Man, Tapper, Journey, Timber, Crater Raider | Data Bit 0–7 (standard/unused bus) |
| Kick/Kickman | Spinner X (D0–D7) |
| Tron | Opt/Main spinner (D0–D7) |
| Kozmik Krooz'r | Spinner X (D0–D7) |
| Wacko | Trackball X-Axis (D0–D7) |
| Discs of Tron | Rotary aim (D0–D7) |
| Spy Hunter | Steering/Gas (D0–D7) |

## J5 — Opt Y / trackball / Player 2 controls

| Pin | Std function | WA | TA | TI | DT | others |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| J5-1..J5-6 | P2 Mux / Data Bit 0–5 (Opt Y) | Trackball Y (D0–D5) | - | - | - | - |
| J5-15 | P2 Up / Data Bit 6 | Trackball Y (D6) | P2 Up | P2 Up | Aim Up | - |
| J5-16 | P2 Down / Data Bit 7 | Trackball Y (D7) | P2 Down | P2 Down | Aim Down | - |
| J5-17 | P2 Left | - | P2 Left | P2 Left | - | - |
| J5-18 | P2 Right | - | P2 Right | P2 Right | - | - |
| J5-19 | P2 Button 1 | - | P2 Pour | - | - | - |

## Video connector (identical across all games)

| Pin | Function |
|---|---|
| Video-1 | Red |
| Video-2 | Video GND |
| Video-3 | Green |
| Video-4 | Video GND |
| Video-5 | Blue |
| Video-6 | Video GND |
| Video-7 | Key |
| Video-8 | H-Sync (−) |
| Video-9 | V-Sync (−) |

## From connector pins to SSIO input ports (FPGA-internal)

The connector matrix above is cabinet wiring. The mapping of those switches
into the SSIO's `input_0..input_4` byte ports is per-game and must be taken
from MAME (`src/mame/midway/mcr.cpp`, `INPUT_PORTS_START(<game>)`); the
matrix cannot tell you bit positions. Verified examples:

- **Domino Man** — IP0 = {test, service1, tilt, **Button1**, start2, start1,
  coin2, coin1}; IP1 = {4'unused, down, up, right, left} (4-way);
  IP3 DIP upright default = `0x3E` (0xFF selects cocktail!).
- **Satan's Hollow** — IP0 = {service, x, tilt, x, start2, start1, coin2,
  coin1}; IP1 = {P2 fire, P2 shield, P2 right, P2 left, fire, shield,
  right, left}.
- **Tron** — IP0 = standard {test, service1, tilt, TRIGGER, start2, start1,
  coin2, coin1}; IP1 = 8-bit absolute aim dial (PORT_REVERSE); IP2 = P1
  8-way joystick [3:0] (+P2 cocktail [7:4]); IP3 DIP upright default =
  `0x80` (bit7 is the cocktail trigger input, idle high); IP4 = cocktail
  dial.
- **Wacko** — IP1 = trackball X, IP2 = trackball Y (free-running counters);
  IP4 = 4-way aim joystick {bit3 up, bit2 down, bit1 left, bit0 right};
  IP0 standard but with no Button 1. The SSIO output port 4 bit 0 muxes
  IP1/IP2 to the *cocktail* player's trackball only, so upright play needs
  no mux support — which is why this runs without exposing SSIO outputs.
- **Kozmik Kroozr** — IP1 packs the cockpit spinner unusually: the SSIO
  custom read returns `((dial & 0x80) >> 1) | ((dial & 0x70) >> 4)`, i.e.
  **bit 6 = dial[7], bits 2:0 = dial[6:4], both ACTIVE HIGH**; bit 7 is
  Button 2 (active low) and bits 5:3 are cockpit sensors. IP2 = analogue
  stick X, IP4 = analogue stick Y, both `0x30..0x98` centred on `0x64`.
- **Two Tigers** — use the **Tron-conversion set (`twotigerc`)**: IP1 = P1
  dial, IP4 = P2 dial, IP2[3:0] = the four fire buttons, IP0 bit 4 =
  "Dogfight Start". The *dedicated* set (`twotiger`) also needs a video-RAM
  address remap at 0xE800 that this core does not implement.

Method for new games: `awk '/INPUT_PORTS_START\( <game> \)/,/INPUT_PORTS_END/'
mcr.cpp` and read the `PORT_BIT` masks. All inputs are active low.

## Known gaps (not covered by the matrix PDF)

- **J6** — MAME lists `ssio:IP4` as "J6 1-8" (auxiliary inputs); the matrix
  has no J6 sheet. Unused by the games above.
- **Outputs** — coin meters / lamps driven by SSIO output ports are not in
  the matrix; original cabinets wire them via J3-area harness. Deferred.
