# MCR Game Input Matrix (machine-readable)

Transcribed from `docs/MCR_Master_Pinouts.pdf` ("Ultimate MCR Master Pinout
Matrix"). This is the source of truth for **what each cabinet input does per
game** (the function map). Only the in-game meaning changes across MCR-1/2/3;
all game-specific mapping is done in the FPGA top, never on the shield PCB.

> **For the PHYSICAL connectors** — real board numbering, pin counts, and
> pitch (only J1 power is .156"; J2 video / J3 audio / J4–J6 inputs are
> .100" MTA) — use **`docs/MCR Series Pinouts.html`** and
> **`docs/shield_wiring.md`**. The `J2/J3/J4/J5` labels in the tables below
> are the PDF's **normalized cabinet-function** scheme, which is NOT the
> physical connector numbering (see the "Connector-numbering caution" near
> the end). E.g. the PDF's "J2 = P1 controls / J3 = coins" are physically on
> the SSIO board's **J4** (IP0+IP1).

Legend: `-` = N/C for that game. "No J5" (MCR-1 and most MCR-2 cabinets have
no J5 harness) is also shown as `-`.

## From connector pins to SSIO input ports (FPGA-internal)

The connector matrix above is cabinet wiring. The mapping of those switches
into the SSIO's `input_0..input_4` byte ports is per-game and must be taken
from MAME (`src/mame/midway/mcr.cpp`, `INPUT_PORTS_START(<game>)`); the
matrix cannot tell you bit positions. Verified examples:

- **Domino Man** — IP0 = {test, service1, tilt, **Button1**, start2, start1,
  coin2, coin1}; IP1 = {4'unused, down, up, right, left} (4-way);
  IP3 DIP upright default = `0x3E` (0xFF selects cocktail!).
- **Satan's Hollow** — IP0 = {service, x, tilt, x, start2, start1, coin2,
  coin1}; IP1 = {P2 fire, P2 shield, P2 right, P2 left, fire, shield,
  right, left}.
- **Tron** — IP0 = standard {test, service1, tilt, TRIGGER, start2, start1,
  coin2, coin1}; IP1 = 8-bit absolute aim dial (PORT_REVERSE); IP2 = P1
  8-way joystick [3:0] (+P2 cocktail [7:4]); IP3 DIP upright default =
  `0x80` (bit7 is the cocktail trigger input, idle high); IP4 = cocktail
  dial.
- **Wacko** — IP1 = trackball X, IP2 = trackball Y (free-running counters);
  IP4 = 4-way aim joystick {bit3 up, bit2 down, bit1 left, bit0 right};
  IP0 standard but with no Button 1. The SSIO output port 4 bit 0 muxes
  IP1/IP2 to the *cocktail* player's trackball only, so upright play needs
  no mux support — which is why this runs without exposing SSIO outputs.
- **Kozmik Kroozr** — IP1 packs the cockpit spinner unusually: the SSIO
  custom read returns `((dial & 0x80) >> 1) | ((dial & 0x70) >> 4)`, i.e.
  **bit 6 = dial[7], bits 2:0 = dial[6:4], both ACTIVE HIGH**; bit 7 is
  Button 2 (active low) and bits 5:3 are cockpit sensors. IP2 = analogue
  stick X, IP4 = analogue stick Y, both `0x30..0x98` centred on `0x64`.
- **Two Tigers** — use the **Tron-conversion set (`twotigerc`)**: IP1 = P1
  dial, IP4 = P2 dial, IP2[3:0] = the four fire buttons, IP0 bit 4 =
  "Dogfight Start". The *dedicated* set (`twotiger`) also needs a video-RAM
  address remap at 0xE800 that this core does not implement.

### MCR-1 games (core src/rtl/mcr1.vhd, board mcr1_console60k)

Verified against the MiSTer Arcade-MCR1 top (which matches MAME mcr.cpp).
All inputs active low; input_3 = the game-option DIP byte.

- **Kick / Kickman** — IP0 = {service, x, x, **kick**(bit4), start2, start1,
  x, coin1}; IP1 = {4'unused, **spinner[3:0]**} (kicker angle, a 4-bit
  absolute value — driven from d-pad L/R through `spinner.sv`, low nibble).
  IP2/IP4 unused. Runs on a rotated monitor (ORIENTATION_SWAP_XY).
- **Solar Fox** — IP0 = {service, x, x, **fire_a**(bit4), **fire_b**(bit3),
  **fire_b**(bit2), x, coin1}; IP1 = {up,down,left,right, up,down,left,right}
  (the 4-way stick mirrored into both nibbles); IP2 = {7'x, **fire_a**(bit0)}.
  ROT90^FLIP_Y.

DIP note: input_3 is a 0xFF placeholder for both (all option switches off)
pending a MAME default cross-check on hardware.

Method for new games: `awk '/INPUT_PORTS_START\( <game> \)/,/INPUT_PORTS_END/'
mcr.cpp` and read the `PORT_BIT` masks. All inputs are active low.

## Where the DIP switches physically live (and connector-number decoding)

Verified against MAME 0.265 (`mcr.cpp` + `mcr3.cpp`): **every SSIO-based MCR
game — all of MCR-1, MCR-2, and MCR-3 — uses the identical input scheme.**
The DIPs never moved between hardware generations:

| SSIO port | Physical location (MAME/schematic comments) | Function |
|---|---|---|
| IP0 | SSIO connector **J4 pins 1–8** | coins, starts, button 1, tilt, service |
| IP1 | SSIO connector **J4 pins 10–13, 15–18** | dial/joystick/trackball-X (per game) |
| IP2 | SSIO connector **J5 pins 1–8** | joystick/trackball-Y/P2 (per game) |
| IP3 | **DIP bank at board location B3 — on the SSIO board, NOT a connector** | game options |
| IP4 | SSIO connector **J6 pins 1–8** | second dial / aux (per game) |

Answers to the obvious questions:

- **Did the DIPs move around per game/generation? No.** One bank, location
  B3 on the Super Sound I/O board, read as IP3, on every SSIO game from
  Kick (1981) through Discs of Tron (1983). Physically a 10-position bank;
  8 positions reach IP3 (Tron's manual: 9 unused, 10 = freeze).
- **Do the DIPs plug into a connector / get unplugged for a fire button or
  spinner? No.** The DIPs are switches mounted on the board; buttons and
  spinners arrive on the J4/J5/J6 harness connectors — electrically separate
  lines. Nothing is ever unplugged.
- **Then how does Tron put a cocktail fire button "in" IP3 bit 7?** The
  harness wire and DIP position 8 are two contacts on the *same* active-low
  input line, in parallel. The manual's convention: leave SW1-8 OFF
  (open) so the button can pull the line. Our shield replicates exactly
  this: the FPGA ORs the SW1 bit with the harness line — leave the switch
  off, the button works; leave it on, the input is held active, which is
  precisely what the original hardware would do too.
- **There is a SECOND DIP bank** most people never touch: 6 switches on the
  SSIO read by the *sound* Z80 at 0xF000 (MAME's `ssio:DIP` port). Every
  game we've extracted leaves it unused (0xFF); it is sound-board config,
  not game options. We model it as constant 0xFF.

**Connector-numbering caution — three schemes, don't mix them:**

1. **Normalized cabinet-function** (this file's top tables + the master
   PDF): J2 = P1 controls, J3 = coins, J4 = Opt X, J5 = Opt Y. A *logical*
   grouping, not physical connectors.
2. **Real SSIO/CPU board** (`MCR Series Pinouts.html`, and MAME's `ssio:IP*`
   comments): J1 = power (.156" MTA), J2 = video, J3 = audio, **J4 = IP0
   (pins 1-8) + IP1 (10-18)**, J5 = IP2, J6 = IP4 (all .100" MTA). **Use
   this for the shield's physical connectors and footprints.**
3. **Real MCR3Mono board** (MAME `mcr3.cpp`): IP0/IP1 = J2, IP2 = J3,
   IP4 = J4 — different again (mono is a later single board).

So e.g. the PDF's "J3 coin door" and "J2 P1 controls" are physically on the
SSIO board's **J4** (IP0+IP1). Treat the PDF's function names as truth and
its J-labels as logical only; for hardware, use scheme 2 (SSIO) — that is
what `docs/shield_wiring.md` builds the connector footprints from.

## Known gaps (not covered by the matrix PDF)

- **J6** — MAME lists `ssio:IP4` as "J6 1-8" (auxiliary inputs); the matrix
  has no J6 sheet. Unused by the games above.
- **Outputs** — coin meters / lamps driven by SSIO output ports are not in
  the matrix; original cabinets wire them via J3-area harness. Deferred.

## SSIO output port 4 — what each game drives with it

Transcribed from MAME `bally/mcr.cpp` (`init_*` registers a handler via
`m_ssio->set_custom_output(4, MASK, ...)`; the mask is which bits are custom).
This is the authority for wiring cabinet loads to the shield's 74HC595 →
ULN2803 chain — `docs/shield_j10_pinout.md` §4 already reserves bits for it.

Our cores expose this as the `output_4` port on `mcr2.vhd` / `mcr3.vhd` /
`mcr3scroll.vhd`.

| Game | Mask | Bits | What it drives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Journey** | `0x01` | bit 0 | **Cassette deck on/off.** See below. |
| **Two Tigers** (dedicated) | `0xff` | bit 1 | **Two cassette decks** (`left`, `right`), both gated by the same bit |
| Wacko | `0x01` | bit 0 | Trackball input mux (P1 vs cocktail P2) |
| Kozmik Kroozr | `0x34` | 2, 4, 5 | Ship control; cargo light 1; cargo light 2 |
| Discs of Tron | `0xff` | 6, 7 | Flasher control board: bit 6 = lamp direct (J1-4), bit 7 = 8.57 Hz strobe enable (J1-3), wire-ORed |
| Demolition Derby | `0xff` | 6, 7 | Input mux select; the rest goes to the Turbo Cheap Squeak sound board |
| Spy Hunter | — | — | Lamp panel, via the core's `show_lamps` rather than a custom op4 |

### Journey's cassette — the mechanism

```c
void mcr_state::journey_op4_w(uint8_t data)
{
    if (!m_samples->playing(0))
        m_samples->start(0, 0, true);   // start it LOOPING, once
    m_samples->pause(0, ~data & 1);     // bit 0 gates it
}
```

Three things follow, and they matter for supporting a real deck:

1. **It is an endless-loop cassette.** The sample starts once with the loop
   flag set and never stops — the game only ever pauses and resumes it.
2. **One bit, active high.** `0x01` mask, bit 0. High = tape running.
3. **Pause, not stop-and-rewind.** Position is preserved across pauses, so the
   music resumes mid-phrase exactly as a motor-gated tape loop would.

Our `wave_sound.sv` port has `I_LOOP` and `I_PAUSE` inputs that map onto this
one-for-one; upstream MiSTer wires `pause <= ~output_4[0]`, which matches
MAME's `~data & 1`.

### The game gates it REPEATEDLY, and that decides the implementation

**alanswx (who wrote the upstream MiSTer wave code) reports the game gates the
tape repeatedly during a musical sequence, not once per credit.** Two
consequences, and they point in the opposite direction to the obvious
"just buy a cheap MP3 module" answer:

1. **Level-triggered module modes are OUT.** The DY-SV5W's I/O Independent
   Mode 1 (*"keep play repeatedly specify the triggered song… stop playing
   immediately after release level"*) RESTARTS the track on each re-assert. A
   sequence that gates repeatedly would slam back to the top of the song every
   time. Pause/resume that preserves position is mandatory — i.e. serial
   control, not a level.
2. **Module command LATENCY becomes a real risk.** Modules in this class take
   **200–500 ms** to act on a serial command (measured across DFPlayer chip
   variants; the DY-SV5W is the same family). If the gating is musical, half a
   second of slop on each pause and resume is plainly audible. The internal
   `wave_sound` path has **zero** latency — `I_PAUSE` is a wire.

So repeated gating is an argument FOR playing the music internally, and the
external module is best understood as the option for someone driving a **real
deck** (whose motor responds mechanically anyway) rather than as a cheap
substitute for the internal player. Worth measuring the gating rate before
committing either way: a toggle counter on `journey_tape_run` in the UART
beacon answers it in one credit.

**Supporting a REAL deck** needs no new mechanism: route `output_4[0]` to one
bit of the shield's output '595 → ULN2803 (a spare channel; the deck's motor
relay is exactly the 12 V load that chain exists for), and offer a source
option that mutes/skips the internal WAV. The same bitstream then serves both a
purist cabinet and a bare board.

### Note: we ship the Two Tigers CONVERSION set, which has no tape

`twotigerc` (Tron conversion) uses `init_mcr_90010` — **no custom op4 and no
cassettes at all**, so it is correct as we ship it. Only the dedicated
`twotiger` set has the two tape channels, and that set also needs the videoram
remap at `0xE800` that `CLAUDE.md` records as missing. MAME marks the dedicated
set `MACHINE_IMPERFECT_SOUND`.
