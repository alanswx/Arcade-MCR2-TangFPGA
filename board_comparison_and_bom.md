# FPGA Board Comparison & Custom Shield BOM

This document provides a cost and feature comparison of the various Sipeed Tang FPGA board options for building the Bally Midway MCR arcade core, followed by a Bill of Materials (BOM) estimate for the custom **Option A Shield** (Universal MCR Cabinet Interface).

## 1. FPGA Board & Hardware Setup Comparison

Here is a comparison of the three primary hardware architectures we evaluated for running the MCR arcade core, along with their estimated retail pricing.

| Specification / Option | Tang Primer 25K (V1 On-Chip) | Tang Primer 25K (V2 SDRAM) | Tang Console 60K | Tang Console 138K |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FPGA Chip** | GW5A-LV25 | GW5A-LV25 | GW5A-LV60 | GW5AST-LV138 |
| **Logic Cells (LUT4)** | 23,040 | 23,040 | 60,000 | 138,240 |
| **On-Chip Block RAM** | 126 KB (56 blocks) | 126 KB (56 blocks) | ~320 KB (140+ blocks) | 765 KB (340 blocks) |
| **External Memory** | None | 64Mbit SDRAM Card | **512MB DDR3** (On SOM) | **1GB DDR3** (On SOM) |
| **Free GPIO Pins** | **26** (40-Pin) + **8** (PMOD) | **8** (PMOD 1 only) | **92** (76 GPIO + 16 PMOD) | **92** (76 GPIO + 16 PMOD) |
| **MCR Game Support** | Partial (No Playfield Gfx) | Full MCR-1/2/3 Games | Full MCR-1/2/3 Games | Full MCR-1/2/3 Games |
| **Video & Audio Path** | On-board parallel | HDMI -> VGA/Audio Dongle | Onboard Native HDMI & DAC | Onboard Native HDMI & DAC |
| **Pin Congestion** | Low | High (Requires Shift Reg) | Zero | Zero |
| **Estimated Price (Kit)**| **~$25.00** | **~$35.00** (Kit + SDRAM) | **~$55.00** (SOM + Dock) | **~$99.00** (SOM + Dock) |
| **Extra Modules Needed** | PMOD HDMI ($5) | PMOD HDMI ($5) + Dongle ($5) | None | None |
| **Total Hardware Cost**  | **~$30.00** | **~$45.00** | **~$55.00** | **~$99.00** |

### Recommendations:
* **Best Value / Easiest Integration: Tang Console 60K ($55)**
  Because the DDR3 memory is built directly into the System-on-Module (SOM), it does not block the carrier board's pins. With **92 free GPIO pins**, native HDMI, and onboard audio DACs, you do not need shift registers or HDMI converters. It has more than enough on-chip block RAM (320KB) to run any MCR game without memory limits.
* **Cheapest Entry Point: Tang Primer 25K V1 ($30)**
  Great for initial desk testing and cabinet control/audio wiring verification. However, playfield background graphics are disabled to fit the block RAM budget.

## 2. Custom Shield Bill of Materials (BOM) Estimate

Below is the estimated Bill of Materials to manufacture and assemble the custom **Option A Interface Shield** (Universal MCR Cabinet Interface).

### Option A.1: Parallel Shield (For Tang Primer 25K V1, or Tang Console 60K/138K)
This PCB is a passive shield that routes video, audio, and inputs in parallel. It is simple, highly reliable, and uses no active serial ICs.

| Item | Component Description | Designator | Qty | Unit Cost | Total Cost | Source Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Custom PCB (2-Layer)** | Board | 1 | $2.00 | $2.00 | JLCPCB / PCBWay (qty 5 minimum) |
| 2 | **opto-isolators (4-channel)** | U1, U2, U3 | 3 | $0.40 | $1.20 | TLP281-4 (SMD) |
| 3 | **LM386 Mono Audio Amp** | U4 | 1 | $0.35 | $0.35 | LM386 (DIP or SOIC) |
| 4 | **5V Step-Down Buck Regulator** | VR1 | 1 | $1.20 | $1.20 | LM2596 Module or MP1584EN |
| 5 | **R2R Resistor Arrays (10k/20k)** | RN1, RN2, RN3 | 3 | $0.20 | $0.60 | 9-pin SIP Resistor Network |
| 6 | **Discrete Resistors & Caps** | R1-R20, C1-C10 | 1 | $1.00 | $1.00 | 0805 SMD Resistors/Capacitors |
| 7 | **BC847 NPN Transistor** (Sync) | Q1, Q2 | 2 | $0.05 | $0.10 | BC847 (SOT-23) |
| 8 | **MCR Connector Headers** | J2, J3, J4, J5 | 4 | $0.50 | $2.00 | 2.54mm Pin Headers / Molex KK |
| 9 | **Female Pin Headers (to Dock)** | JP1, JP2 | 2 | $0.40 | $0.80 | 40-Pin and PMOD sockets |
| **Total**| | | | | **~$9.25** | *Excludes shipping (~$15 from China)* |

### Option A.2: Serial Shift-Register Shield (For Tang Primer 25K V2 + SDRAM)
If using the SDRAM card on the Tang Primer 25K, you must read the buttons serially due to pin starvation. This shield adds shift registers to read controls over 3 PMOD pins.

| Item | Component Description | Designator | Qty | Unit Cost | Total Cost | Source Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Custom PCB (2-Layer)** | Board | 1 | $2.00 | $2.00 | JLCPCB |
| 2 | **74HC165 8-bit Shift Register**| U1, U2 | 2 | $0.15 | $0.30 | 74HC165 (SOIC-16) |
| 3 | **opto-isolators (4-channel)** | U3, U4 | 2 | $0.40 | $0.80 | TLP281-4 |
| 4 | **5V Step-Down Buck Regulator** | VR1 | 1 | $1.20 | $1.20 | MP1584EN Buck Board |
| 5 | **Discrete Resistors & Caps** | R1-R20, C1-C10 | 1 | $1.00 | $1.00 | 0805 SMD |
| 6 | **MCR Connector Headers** | J2, J3, J4, J5 | 4 | $0.50 | $2.00 | 2.54mm Molex KK |
| 7 | **Female Pin Headers (to Dock)** | JP1 | 1 | $0.40 | $0.40 | 12-pin PMOD socket |
| **Total**| | | | | **~$7.70** | *Excludes shipping* |
